To conclude this paper has applied 6 different configurations of GA to the game Ludo
and found configuration C3 to have the best performance with a mean avg win rate of 58.3\%.
This configuration was then compared to the best 
from a comparative paper\cite*{peter} which used a different set of hyperparameter configurations
and chromosome representation with a mean avg win rate of 60.9\%. The comparison showed that 
the GA from the comparative paper performs statically significantly better than the 
one found in this paper. The difference between the configurations was then discussed 
with possible changes and improvements to the approach applied in this paper.
